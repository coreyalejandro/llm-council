# Zero‑Shot‑Build™ Principles (v1.0)

Zero‑Shot‑Build is the method for constructing interfaces, products and
platforms without starting from scratch.  It marries creative intuition with
hard accountability.  These principles are written in a vibe‑affirming but
truth‑enforced tone: nothing is softened and nothing is oversold.

## 1. Vibes Are Valid — and Accountable

Intuition, taste and creative instinct are respected.  They initiate
movement.  REASONS and the library give them shape, guardrails and proof.
Nothing is dismissed, but nothing is left unjustified.

## 2. Nothing Is Built Arbitrarily

Every artefact—design, code, interaction or decision—must have
conscientious vibes behind it and traceable reasons beneath it.  If you
cannot explain why something exists and behaves the way it does, it is not
ready.

## 3. Reuse Is Respect for What Already Works

We do not rebuild to prove originality.  We reuse and refactor because good
ideas deserve longevity, consistency compounds trust and invention should
extend the system, not fragment it.  Originality expresses itself through
refinement, not duplication.

## 4. Creativity Comes First — Governance Comes Next

We do not ask creativity to justify itself *before* it appears.  We let
ideas emerge—unabashedly inventive and unconventionally rational.  Then we
verify, harden, normalize and make them safe to scale.  There is no gate on
the spark; there is a gate on publication.

## 5. Design and Code Are a Single Conversation

Design is not decoration and code is not translation.  They evolve together,
bound by the same rules.  If a decision cannot survive both lenses, it does
not ship.

## 6. Libraries Are Living Memory, Not Static Catalogues

Our component library records what worked, why it worked and how to reuse it.
Every addition improves clarity, reduces duplication or hardens reliability.
Refactors are not regressions; they are how the system remembers.

## 7. Documentation Is a Creative Act

Documentation is not a receipt; it is synthesis.  Prompt‑Plan‑Production™
captures the initial vibe, the decisions it became and the product it
produced.  This makes work seeable, teachable, transferable and humane.

## 8. Quality Is Felt *and* Proven

We ship things that feel right, work reliably, scale safely and respect the
people using and maintaining them.  “Good” means verified, repeatable,
seeable, hardened and humane.  No exceptions.

## 9. Zero‑Shot Does Not Mean Zero‑Care

Zero‑Shot‑Build means no blank‑page panic, no arbitrary invention and no
accidental complexity.  It does *not* mean rushed, reckless or
disconnected from human judgment.  Speed comes from clarity, not shortcuts.

## Principle Summary

> **We trust vibes enough to take responsibility for them.  We turn intuition
> into systems.  And we make creativity safe to scale.**

These principles should guide every decision.  When in doubt, return to
them—and to REASONS and UPOS‑7‑VS—for direction.
