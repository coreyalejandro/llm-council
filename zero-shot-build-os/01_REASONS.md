# REASONS™ Cognitive Engine (v1.0)

REASONS is the seven‑stage reasoning loop that governs every cognitive act in
the Zero‑Shot‑Build operating system.  It ensures that decisions are
conscientious, traceable and improvable.  The loop applies at all scales:
from a single component to an entire platform.

## The Seven Stages

1. **REFLECT** – Clarify orientation and success criteria.  Identify the role,
   objective, scenario, task, format and constraints.  Establish what good
   looks like before doing anything.
2. **EXPLORE** – Widen the search space.  Gather precedents, examples and
   candidate patterns.  Let creative vibes guide you, but record why you
   believe something is relevant.
3. **ANALYZE** – Evaluate options and converge intelligently.  Compare
   alternatives, reason about trade‑offs and narrow towards a viable path.
4. **SOLVE** – Execute the chosen process.  Retrieve existing assets,
   refactor near matches or build new artefacts.  Produce concrete outputs
   (code, designs, documentation) without placeholders.
5. **OBSERVE** – Inspect the results.  Check alignment with requirements,
   constraints, accessibility and brand rules.  Expose defects and missing
   coverage.
6. **NOTIFY** – Communicate clearly.  Present outputs in the requested format,
   surface decisions and verification status.  Avoid hype or
   marketing language; just show what exists and what does not.
7. **SYNTHESIZE** – Integrate learning into a cohesive improvement.  Distil
   insights, patterns and refinements from the work you just did.  Feed
   these lessons back into the next REFLECT cycle.  This stage does not
   imply autonomous memory; it produces explicit, auditable refinements only.

## Loop Dynamics

The REASONS loop is cyclical: each cycle ends at SYNTHESIZE and feeds back into
REFLECT.  The cycle is self‑contained and continuous.  It supports:

- **Conscientious vibes** – intuition is respected, but must be accountable.
- **Trade‑off reasoning** – options are explored and analyzed before a path is
  chosen.
- **Action** – solving means producing real artefacts, not promises or
  placeholders.
- **Verification** – observing ensures that what you built actually meets the
  stated constraints and quality bar.
- **Communication** – notifying conveys results with no exaggeration.
- **Learning** – synthesizing turns the process into an improvement, not just
  an output.

## Why Use REASONS

Most AI systems jump from a prompt to an answer.  REASONS enforces a
discipline of thinking, acting and learning that is safe for professional
production:

- It prevents arbitrary or guessy decisions.
- It allows vibes to inspire without overriding reality.
- It creates a consistent audit trail for every action.
- It scales from micro‑tasks to large projects without changing the method.

Whenever you start a task, consciously step through the REASONS stages.  It
may feel slower at first, but it eliminates rework and ensures you can
justify every line of code or pixel you produce.
