# Zero‑Shot‑Build™ Operating System (v1.0)

Welcome to the Zero‑Shot‑Build operating system.  This folder contains the canonical
documentation for a deterministic, library‑first build methodology that combines
a cognitive reasoning loop, a prompt specification, build principles, a library
governance framework, a documentation artifact and a truth & quality guarantee.

## What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **01_REASONS.md** | Defines the REASONS™ cognitive engine, a seven‑stage cycle for how to think and act. |
| **02_UPOS-7-VS.md** | Describes the Unified Prompt Operating System used to structure requests and outputs. |
| **03_ZERO-SHOT-BUILD_PRINCIPLES.md** | Lists the core principles for building everything from components to platforms. |
| **04_COMPONENT_LIBRARY_GOVERNANCE.md** | Governs how the component library is managed, from reuse to approval. |
| **05_PROMPT-PLAN-PRODUCTION.md** | Details the Prompt‑Plan‑Production™ artifact that records every project. |
| **06_TRUTH_QUALITY_GUARANTEE.md** | Enforces honesty and quality across all outputs. |

## Using the OS

1. **Start every task by aligning on intent** using UPOS‑7‑VS: specify the role, objective,
   context, task, desired format, constraints and verification criteria.
2. **Follow the REASONS loop** to think and act: Reflect → Explore → Analyze → Solve → Observe → Notify →
   Synthesize.  Each stage produces a clear, audit‑able output.
3. **Apply the Zero‑Shot‑Build principles** to decide whether to reuse, refactor or create
   components.  Vibes (intuition) are welcome but must be accountable.
4. **Use the component library** as the single source of truth.  All components live there
   with documentation, variants and approvals.
5. **Document every project** with Prompt‑Plan‑Production™.  The prompt captures intent,
   the plan records decisions and the production section shows the final artefacts and
   limitations.
6. **Never overstate or lie**.  Consult the Truth & Quality Guarantee to avoid hype and
   enforce verifiable completeness.

This operating system is designed to eliminate guesswork and “AI slop.”  It
supports creative intuition while ensuring that outputs are professional,
reliable and reproducible.  Each file in this package is a standalone
reference that should be consulted as you build and maintain products.  Do not
modify these documents casually; they form the legal and moral backbone of your
workflow.
